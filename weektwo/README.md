I have created a website using many different cards and objects using bootstrap, linking in and finding the best options to recreate the exapmles.

I have altered many items, for example, I linked in google fonts, to alter the font style for all of my pages, and have used the same for each page to create continuity. I have also linked in images from the web, and have created files in VS code to use photos that I had downloaded on my computer. 

I also connected my pages with a css document to alter a few of the details as well, such as background color, margins, and the google fonts.
