              Hello! My name is Logan Felsted. I grew up here in Utah for most
              of my life. I love to travel so my early twenties were full of
              adventure. I have worked in Food and Beverage for 5 years now and
              have really enjoyed a lot of aspects of the job. However, I would
              like to actually be able to live anywhere in this world, which has
              led me down this path. I have a lot of friends in the industry,
              and my Dad has been a programer my entire life. So I have quite
              the reference for the life style. I have a 8 month old dog named
              Frank, he is a very sweet and fun Doberman. I love spending time
              with my friends, family, my dog and especially my lady. I enjoy
              dining, and the ins and outs of wine. Also am a big fan of golf,
              before this I was trying to play 2-3 times a week. If you have any
              questions feel free to ask! I'm very excited to be here and learn
              with all of you.
